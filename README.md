## What is Silencer?

It is the near future on Mars, and the government is up to no good. As a result, there are powers that are trying to overthrow the government, known as Silencers. They are hackers and brokers of secrets, and they are not friendly to each other. Choose your agency well, and be wary and fast.

Silencer pits you against other players online. You are all vying for secrets, and trying to get rid of your competition through disguise, traps, and straight out shooting. At the same time, you need to beat them to the Secrets, and get the Secrets back to your base without getting killed. Use technology to your advantage, but choose your timing well.

You start with a blaster and a few laser charges, and the ability to disguise yourself as a civilian. Walk to a green terminal, and hit the space bar to start hacking. Within a few seconds, you will have a file, and may have part of the puzzle to where the Secret lies. The down side to hacking is that you are exposed! The enemy which is anyone with a gun, will see you hacking if you are disguised, and can take a shot at you while you are intent on the hack ...so, be careful. However, if you are not diguised, you're dead meat... they will know you in a minute. Run back to your base with the file, get some credits, and buy some tech or ammo. Now out you go again.
