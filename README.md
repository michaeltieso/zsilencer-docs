## What is Silencer?

It is the near future on Mars, and the government is up to no good. As a result, there are powers that are trying to overthrow the government, known as Silencers. They are hackers and brokers of secrets, and they are not friendly to each other. Choose your agency well, and be wary and fast.

Silencer pits you against other players online. You are all vying for secrets, and trying to get rid of your competition through disguise, traps, and straight out shooting. At the same time, you need to beat them to the Secrets, and get the Secrets back to your base without getting killed. Use technology to your advantage, but choose your timing well.

You start with a blaster and a few laser charges, and the ability to disguise yourself as a civilian. Walk to a green terminal, and hit the space bar to start hacking. Within a few seconds, you will have a file, and may have part of the puzzle to where the Secret lies. The down side to hacking is that you are exposed! The enemy which is anyone with a gun, will see you hacking if you are disguised, and can take a shot at you while you are intent on the hack ...so, be careful. However, if you are not diguised, you're dead meat... they will know you in a minute. Run back to your base with the file, get some credits, and buy some tech or ammo. Now out you go again.

## History of Silencer

Silencer was released in 1999 by Mind Control Software and was playable through Won.net. After 13 years, the game is back online.

Silencer is multiplayer only team based capture-the-flag style game. Players control high-tech hackers on Mars called "Silencers," who are trying to overthrow the tyrannical Martian government. Hack military computers, then stash the recovered secrets in your hidden base. The first team of Silencers to retrieve three top secrets wins the mission. The losers are identified and destroyed by the Martian Central Authority. There are five underground Silencer agencies vying for power. Players choose one when they create a Silencer character.

Valve had acquired World Opponent Network (Won.net) in 2001 and began to implement all of its features into Steam. By May 2001, many of the servers had shut down in favor of Steam. Since Silencer was using Won.net servers, the game went offline and never returned. Mind Control Software had no interest to continuing to develop the game. Although Silencer was no longer playable online, the community stuck together for years in hopes of bringing the game back.

13 years later an anonymous fan of Silencer took on the task of recreating Silencer. [zSilencer](http://zsilencer.com) is a 99% replica of the original Silencer and completely functional and online. Many of the players that played 13 years ago are coming back and new people are discovering the game. I suspect this game is going to be popular again. The community is strong and growing with nightly games going on for hours with several large matches.
